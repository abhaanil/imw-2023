        <h1>A HANDMADE WEB - J.R. CARPENTER</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h2>
        <p>This article talks about the “handmade web”. By handmade web” the author refers to a time of the early-internet days which was the mid 1990’s where webpages were manually created by individuals without using automated softwares. These web pages were representative of the individualistic expression of the maker and often experimental. After the corporate take-over of the internet, we mostly rely on big companies for everything on the internet. For example: when I want to create a portfolio website, I would probably select some pre-made templates on the internet and so will a million of others. This would end up making everything look the same. In essence, the thesis of this article is a call to preserve and cherish the spirit the early days of internet, where we play an active role in shaping the online world rather than relying on big companies.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?</h2>
        <p>Carpenter describes the handmade web’s slowness and smallness as a form of resistance. The handmade web is a way of doing things differently. It is slower and smaller, but also has a personal and creative touch to it. This unique quality definitely stands out in today’s web which is filled with similar looking templates from big companies. It’s resisting the idea that the internet is mainly about big businesses making money from ads and selling things. Instead, the author pushes the idea that the internet is about regular people having their creative space online. He says that the act of hand-coding and self-publishing web content is a form of resistance against the growing commercialization and standardisation of the internet. It means, taking control of the internet instead of letting big companies do it.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the “physicality” of the web?</h2>
        <p>I had come across this really interesting website: “If the moon were only 1 pixel: a tediously accurate scale model of the solar system.” Here is the link:</p>
        <a href=" https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html"> https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html </a>
        <p>This website represents an accurate model of our solar system. As we tediously scroll through the website, we can get a sense of the vastness of the space and the physical relationship between the planets and other objects.</p>

        <h1>WHAT SCREENS WANT - FRANK CHIMERO</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h2>
        <p>The author started of by asking what screens want? But over the course of the article the writer believes that its more important for the screens to match what we want. Screens and technology have evolved a lot and it is important for us, designers, to focus on how things have changed and adapt them when designing for them.
        The author also criticizes the current state of the internet which is dominated by big companies and their commercial interests which is further away from the original vision of the internet. The article suggests that we need to circle back to the original vision which focuses on being open and creative, allowing people to communicate freely without being watched, building communities rather than concentrating power to big companies.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?</h2>
        <p>I personally feel the choice between flat design and skeuomorphism should depend on the target audience, project goals and the desired user experience. However, if I had to choose, I usually go for the flat and minimalistic design approach. I believe it makes the design user friendly and the interface more intuitive. This kind of design also requires fewer graphical elements which makes the file less heavy and reduces the loading time. But also the previous reading has influenced me a bit, and I do agree that our webpages need to have a little bit of character and personality to it and flatter design, even though it being efficient, is kind of boring. So I am actually torn between the two ideologies.But to conclude, I would circle back to the first point I made, which was, the project brief and the target audience would define the style that one should go for.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web design and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h2>
        <p>I had come across this really interesting website: “If the moon were only 1 pixel: a tediously accurate scale model of the solar system.” Here is the link:</p>
        <a href=" https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html"> https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html </a>
        <p>A zoopraxiscope was a device that was invented in the late 19th century to create an illusion of motion by displaying a series of still images in rapid succession. It was the foundation of the modern-day animation. In the web-design and interaction design concept, the zoopraxiscope serves as a historical example of how the concept of motion and animation has evolved in web-designing to create more user-engaging and interactive designs.
            An example of animation that has been adapted in digital design is parallax scrolling. This technique creates illusion of depth by moving different layers at different speeds. As the users scroll, they perceive a sense of depth because the foreground content appears to move faster than the background elements, similar to how our eyes perceive depth in the real world. This technique is often used in 2D animation to create a 3 dimensional illusion between the foreground, midground and background.</p>

        <h1>INTERFACE AND INTERPRETATION - JOHANNA DRUCKER</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>1. How does Drucker define the term "interface"? How about the process of designing interfaces? What is her opinion of interface design processes as they are generally handled today?</h2>
        <p>Drucker defines an "interface" as the place where people interact with computers and digital information. It's like a bridge between us and the digital world, which includes how it looks and how it works.

            When it comes to designing these interfaces, Drucker thinks it should be more than just making things pretty and easy to use. She believes designers should think about how digital stuff affects our society and the way we learn and communicate. It's not just about making it look good; it's about making it helpful.
            
            Drucker is not very happy with how we usually design interfaces today. She says that we often focus too much on making things efficient and straightforward, caring more about the technology than the people using it. She wants us to change this and see interfaces as more than just tools. She thinks we should make them places for people to have conversations and learn together. She wants us to be more thoughtful, open to different ideas, and less focused on making everything perfect. In short, she wants us to make interfaces that are more user-friendly, human-centered, and open to different perspectives.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. What is Drucker's notion of "Humanistic Design"?</h2>
        <p>In Drucker's vision of "Humanistic Design," the primary focus is on creating digital products, interfaces, and systems that are not just efficient but also deeply considerate of people's needs, cultural backgrounds, and the complexities of human interactions.

            Humanistic Design is about designing technology that doesn't just work but also respects and enhances our understanding and experience. It acknowledges that technology is not used in isolation but within the context of society and culture. Therefore, it's not just about making things that work quickly and are easy to use, but about making technology that is more thoughtful, inclusive, and open to diverse interpretations.
            
            This approach looks at the messy and intricate ways people interact with technology and doesn't insist on everything being perfectly clear or one-size-fits-all. It recognizes that people have different preferences, habits, and ways of thinking, and that technology should adapt to accommodate those differences.
            
            In essence, Humanistic Design aims to create digital products and interfaces that are user-friendly, culturally sensitive, and responsive to the diverse and ever-changing ways in which humans connect and communicate in the digital world. It's a call for friendlier, more inclusive, and user-focused designs that consider the richness of human experience.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. As a process, what factors do you feel are central to the design of interfaces that are missing from this article?</h2>
        <p>An important aspect of interface design that I felt was missing from the article deals with Response time and performance of the website.

            In today's digital world, people expect things to happen quickly when they use websites or apps. Whether they're opening a website, clicking on a button, or typing in a search bar, they want to see results almost instantly. If things are slow and take a long time, it can make users annoyed. Slow websites or apps also make people leave before they even look at what's there or finish what they wanted to do. Imagine you went to a store, but you left right away because there was a huge queue at the entrance.
            
            It's a big problem for websites because when many people leave quickly, it makes them less popular on search engines and leads to fewer sales. The speed of a website or app affects how much you enjoy using it. A fast and quick one gives you a good experience, while a slow and laggy one gives you a bad experience. People prefer and keep coming back to websites and apps that work smoothly and quickly. So, it's important for websites and apps to be fast and responsive, meaning they react quickly when you do something. This makes users happy, and they stay longer and come back more often.</p>

            <h1>DATABASE AS A SYMBOLIC FORM - LEV MANOVICH</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>1. How does Manovich see the opposition between database and narrative? Manovich talks about computer games as a form of Interactive Narrative. Can you speculate on other forms of interactive narratives (in our culture or imagined) that aren't computer games?</h2>
            <p>Lev Manovich's perspective on the opposition between database and narrative is a central theme in his work, "Database as Symbolic Form." He views databases and narratives as two contrasting models for organizing information. Database, according to Manovich, a is a structure that arranges information in a non-linear, modular format. It's a collection of discrete items that can be accessed or rearranged in various ways. Databases lack a fixed sequence or overarching storyline; they represent a set of individual elements without an inherent order.

                In contrast, narratives follow a linear, cause-and-effect progression. They provide a structured sequence of events with a beginning, middle, and end, often following a character or plot development.
                
                A recent assignment that I did for IMW class was a Create your own adventure story, that was a form of an interactive narrative where a user would get to make choices and the story would unfold based on those choices. It also reminds me of Black Mirror’s interactive feature film called Bandersnatch which was released on Netflix a while ago. They had to shoot various pathways and endings that were influenced by the users decisions.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>2. Database as Symbolic Form was written 19 years ago now. What has changed? What hasn't changed? Did Manovich's predictions come true?</h2>
            <p>Lev Manovich's book "Database as Symbolic Form" was published almost 2 decades ago, providing insights into the shifting paradigms of media, culture, and technology. Examining the changes and continuities since then reveals several notable developments.

                The technological landscape has evolved significantly since 2001. The advancement of mobile devices, high-speed internet, cloud computing, and advancements in AI and machine learning has transformed how data is accessed, processed, and stored. Another significant impact would be the rise of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube have democratized content creation and distribution. Users now contribute substantially to the generation and dissemination of vast amounts of data, blurring the line between producers and consumers.
                
                The shift towards personalized content and interactive experiences has become more prevalent in various fields, including entertainment, marketing, education, and healthcare. AI-driven recommendation systems and personalized interfaces have become commonplace.
                Most of Manovich's predictions have materialized, such as the growing significance of databases in structuring digital information and the rise of interactive media forms, other developments. Infact, the extent of user-generated content and the impact of big data analytics, may have surpassed his initial anticipations.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>3. Can you draw a connection between Manovich's ideas and your plan for your final project?</h2>
            <p>I would say at this point of time, the idea for my final project remains a bit vague. But I have always gravitated to the idea of interactive story telling in most of my projects (knowingly or unknowingly). The very first 'story book' project I did for this class revealed a Misfortune cookie based on the choices you made.  So, based on my previous decisions, it is very likely that I would have narrative linked to my final project and various user choices would reveal a random project.

                As discussed in the class, the playground idea remains and the forefront of how I visualize my final index page. Maybe, I might incorporate a character that moves with various keyboard controls and explores different playing setups in the playground which happen to be the different projects.</p>

                <h1>MY WEBSITE IS A SHIFTING HOUSE NEXT TO A RIVER OF KNOWLEDGE -  LAUREL SCHWULST</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h2>
                <p>Laura Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media platforms due to several reasons that align with the idea of personalized expression, control and preservation of indivuality. I completely agree with her. Websites can be highly personalized, allowing individuals to express themselves in unique ways. Unlike social media platforms, which often have standardized templates and layouts, personal websites can reflect an individual's personality, creativity, and style. This uniqueness can foster deeper connections with the audience and provide a more authentic representation of oneself.

                    Another important factor being the lifespan of both the platforms. Individual websites can persist over time, often creating a lasting digital presence. Social media posts tend to have a shorter lifespan due to the fast-paced nature of platforms and algorithm changes. Websites offer the opportunity to create a more permanent archive of one's thoughts, work, and achievements.
                    
                    However, what I finally believe is that a balanced approach might involve utilizing both channels strategically, leveraging the strengths of each to create a comprehensive online presence while maintaining control and ownership of personal content.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your Github server and post the link here.</h2>
                <p>My metaphor for personal website is a blank piece of paper; but a crumpled one so I don’t get intimidated. It symbolizes the starting point of creation, much like an individual website marks the beginning of a digital journey. As ideas are fleshed out and content is added, the website evolves, grows, and matures over time, capturing the creator's progress and development.

                    Just as a blank piece of paper holds the initial, raw thoughts and ideas of its creator, a personal website serves as a repository for authentic, original content. It allows individuals to maintain the integrity of their work, uninfluenced by external factors like trending topics or algorithms that often shape content on social media platforms.
                    
                    So here I present to you, my blank paper. Feel free to scribble on it =) </p>
