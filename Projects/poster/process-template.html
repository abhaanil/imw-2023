                    First, I tried to understand the content and objectives of the poster. Then, I sketched out various grid layouts on paper to visualize how the content would fit on the poster.  I experimented with different grid layouts, creating several sketches with varying numbers of columns, rows, and content arrangements. Each layout had its own unique balance and hierarchy. After considering factors like readability, aesthetics, and information hierarchy, I finally chose the grid layout that best suited my design goals and content.

                <h2>Replicating the selected grid in illustrator</h2>
                <p>
                    With the chosen grid layout in mind, I recreated it in Adobe Illustrator.  I began populating the grid with content elements. This included inserting text and other visual components. I made sure to place them within the grid structure according to my initial sketch.

                    I was well aware that creating a compelling poster with just type required careful font selection. I took my time exploring various typefaces that suited the theme and mood of the poster. It was a back-and-forth process as I experimented with different fonts to find the one that resonated best with the message I wanted to convey.  I ensured that the chosen fonts were used consistently throughout the poster. This consistency created a cohesive and professional look. It also made the content more legible and visually appealing. The color scheme played a significant role in setting the tone and mood of the poster. I carefully selected colors that aligned with the message and overall design.

                    Creating the HTML and CSS version of my poster was quite a journey. I must admit that it took me the longest time and required me to learn on the go. But it was a fantastic learning experience, and I can say I now have a much better understanding of how flex-boxes work. One of the most challenging aspects was attempting to create those gradient circles in the background. I had envisioned an interactive design where the circles would respond to the movement of the mouse cursor. However, despite my best efforts, I couldn't quite figure out how to achieve this effect. In the end, I had to settle for uploading a JPEG image as the background, which was a bit disappointing as it wasn't the dynamic element I had envisioned.

                    I was able to replicate the essence of my original poster design in the HTML and CSS version. It might not have been exactly as I had initially imagined, but it was a valuable learning experience, and I'm proud of the result. I look forward to using what I've learned in future projects, perhaps even revisiting the idea of those interactive gradient circles.
